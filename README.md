# Problems Faced:
## * Hookes in react:
I was not femiliar with hooks like useContext and many more I knew what other most commonly used hooks were which I have worked with, but the other hooks which i have yet to work with I haven't even touhed yet so now I Learn the Hooks in react.
* useContext: No need to set props every time a funtion is used. This is what it does...basicaly, This is like creating a special box where you can store some data.
